# Background

##Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement ¨C a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). For this assignment I analyzed the provided data to determine what activity an individual perform. The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

#load("project.Rdata")
```

### Load data 
* Load data.           
* Remove near zero covariates and those with more than 80% missing values since these variables will not provide much power for prediction.       
* Calculate correlations between each remaining feature to the response, `classe`. Use `spearman` rank based correlation because `classe` is a factor.                 
* Plot the two features that have highest correlation with `classe` and color with `classe` to see if we can separate response based on these features.            

```{r data, eval = F}
# load data
training <- read.csv("C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/machine learning/project.Rdata/pml-training.csv", row.names = 1)
testing <- read.csv("C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/machine learning/project.Rdata/pml-training.csv", row.names = 1)
# remove near zero covariates
nsv <- nearZeroVar(training, saveMetrics = T)
training <- training[, !nsv$nzv]
# remove variables with more than 80% missing values
nav <- sapply(colnames(training), function(x) if(sum(is.na(training[, x])) > 0.8*nrow(training)){return(T)}else{return(F)})
training <- training[, !nav]
# calculate correlations
cor <- abs(sapply(colnames(training[, -ncol(training)]), function(x) cor(as.numeric(training[, x]), as.numeric(training$classe), method = "spearman")))
```

```{r data_plot}
# plot predictors 
summary(cor)
plot(training[, names(which.max(cor))], training[, names(which.max(cor[-which.max(cor)]))], col = training$classe, pch = 19, cex = 0.1, xlab = names(which.max(cor)), ylab = names(which.max(cor[-which.max(cor)])))
```

The training set has __`r nrow(training)`__ samples and __`r ncol(training) - 1`__ potential predictors after filtering.          

There doesn't seem to be any strong predictors that correlates with `classe` well, so linear regression model is probably not suitable in this case. Boosting and random forests algorithms may generate more robust predictions for our data.         

### Boosting model
* Fit model with boosting algorithm and 10-fold cross validation to predict `classe` with all other predictors.    
* Plot accuracy of this model on the scale `[0.9, 1]`.        

```{r boost, eval = F}
set.seed(123)
boostFit <- train(classe ~ ., method = "gbm", data = training, verbose = F, trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10))
```
```{r boost_plot}
boostFit
plot(boostFit, ylim = c(0.9, 1))
```

The boosting algorithm generated a good model with __accuracy = 0.997__. 

### Random forests model   
* Fit model with random forests algorithm and 10-fold cross validation to predict `classe` with all other predictors.    
* Plot accuracy of the model on the __same scale__ as boosting model.            

```{r rf, eval = F}
set.seed(123)
rfFit <- train(classe ~ ., method = "rf", data = training, importance = T, trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10))
```
```{r rf_plot}
rfFit
plot(rfFit, ylim = c(0.9, 1))
```
```{r rf_imp, echo = F}
imp <- varImp(rfFit)$importance
imp$max <- apply(imp, 1, max)
imp <- imp[order(imp$max, decreasing = T), ]
```

The random forests algorithm generated a very accurate model with __accuracy close to 1__. Compared to boosting model, this model generally has better performance in terms of accuracy as we see from the plots.                     

### Final model and prediction   
* Comparing model accuracy of the two models generated, random forests and boosting, random forests model has overall better accuracy. So, I'll use this model for prediction.         
* The final random forests model contains 500 trees with 40 variables tried at each split. The five most important predictors in this model are `r rownames(imp)[1:5]`.                 
* Estimated __out of sample error rate__ for the random forests model is __0.04%__ as reported by the final model.            
* Predict the test set and output results for automatic grader.     

```{r prediction, message = F}
# final model
rfFit$finalModel
# prediction
(prediction <- as.character(predict(rfFit, testing)))
```
```{r results, eval = F}
# write prediction files
pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("./prediction/problem_id_", i, ".txt")
    write.table(x[i], file = filename, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
  }
}
pml_write_files(prediction)
```

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
